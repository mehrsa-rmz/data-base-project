Subject:
Data Base System with Graphic Interface for the management of the patients' medical history in a veterinary clinic

Programming languages used:
SQL
PHP
CSS
HTML

Details:
I began the project by sketching the necessary entities for a veterinary clinic and implementing them using "PhpMyAdmin". 
To connect the data base with my code I used XAMPP.
In order to have a general idea of the design of my app I used "Figma". 
There I chose the color pallate, the fonts, the images, the page layout, I made the logo, I decided the funtionalities of the app and the number of pages needed.
For the code I began with the PHP and HTML part and made sure they worked properly, then with CSS I recreated my "Figma" design.
